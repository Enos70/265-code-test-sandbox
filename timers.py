'''
In this example, the program first sorts the data list using the built-in sorted function. 
Then, it attempts a premature optimization by implementing a more complex quicksort algorithm. 
The performance (time taken) of both approaches is measured, demonstrating that the premature 
optimization did not provide a significant benefit and may have even resulted in slower performance.
The program turned out to be prematurely optimized.
