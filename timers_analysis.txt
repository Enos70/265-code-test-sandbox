1.  What is the percentage difference in the average time between the two implementations? You may use the following formula to calculate the percentage difference: ((average_time_1 - average_time_2) / average_time_1) * 100.
2.  Express this difference verbally, e.g. "Implementation x is 10% faster/slower than Implementation x."
3.  Is there greater variation in the average time with the smaller or larger number of tests? What does this tell you about how sample size affects the reliability of performance measurements?

Timers Analysis
1. The percentage difference in average time between the original sort and the optimized sort is calculated as follows:
    ((average_time_original - average_time_optimized) / average_time_original) * 100.

    Test 1:

    Original sort: 0.0001ms
    Optimized sort: 0.0010ms
    The optimized sort is 958.55% faster than the original sort.

    Test 1000

    Original sort: 0.0001ms
    Optimized sort: 0.0011ms

2. Expressing Verbally

    - For 1 test: "The optimized sort is 958.55% faster than the original sort."
    - For 1000 tests: "The optimized sort is 1032.45% faster than the original sort."

3. In terms of variation in average time:
    There is greater variation in the average time with the larger number of tests, indicating that a larger sample size can lead to more reliable performance measurements.

4.  The conclusion is that:
    The consistency across different sample sizes reinforces the conclusion that the optimized sort implementation provides substantial performance benefits over the original sort implementation.
