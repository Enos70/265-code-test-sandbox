Which function takes long to execute a single time? See the comments on lines 21 and 28.
How much time did the program spend in each function over the life of the program?
Based on this data, which of the two functions should we focus on optimizing (trying to reduce execution time of the function call), and why?

Profiling Analysis

1.  Data Interpretation:
   - `other_function1` (line 20 in profiling.py) is called 959 times and consumes a total of 2.001 seconds over the life of the program.
   - `other_function2` (line 27 in profiling.py) is called 41 times and consumes a total of 0.126 seconds over the life of the program.

2.  Performance Bottlenecks
    - `other_function1` takes significantly longer compared to `other_function2`, indicating that it is the performance bottleneck in the program.

    In terms of the total time spent in each function over the life of the program, other_function1 takes significantly longer compared to other_function2. 
    This indicates that other_function1 is likely the performance bottleneck in this scenario.

3. Optimization Focus:
   - Based on the profiling data, `other_function1` should be the focus of optimization efforts due to its higher frequency of calls and longer execution time per call.
   - Justification: Optimizing `other_function1` can lead to significant performance improvements for the overall program by reducing its execution time.

Justification: The profiling data clearly shows that other_function1 accounts for the majority of the program's execution time. 
By optimizing other_function1, we can reduce the overall runtime of the program and improve its efficiency.
